      <h2>What is EverRed Games</h2>
      <p>
        EverRed Games is a worker owned indie game studio dedicated to making great games and a better world. We believe
        that people make better games when they have control over how they work and what they work on. Every member of
        EverRed Games has an equal say on what happens within the company, we are accountable to ourselves and each
        other, not to bosses and owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also believe that thereâ€™s more to life than getting rich. Once business costs and salaries have been paid any
        further profits will be donated to charities. There are so many problems facing our world right now, and we want
        to be some small part of the solution.

      <h3>Warped Cores</h3>
      <p>
        Warped Cores is a fast-paced action game that will see you teleporting around breathtaking arenas as you attempt
        to destroy your opponents. In the far future humanity has spread out among the stars and split into different
        factions, all based around their beliefs on what happens to the soul when a person teleports. In Arena mode you
        will take control of a Spectre, a robotic body designed for teleportation based combat, and represent one of the
        factions in a fight against other Spectres. We are also going to be working on an episodic story mode, where you
        will be able to play solo or in co-op with your friends.
